This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C#.
The creation of this project was inspired by the 26 FEB 2011 Code Retreat in Boulder, CO, USA.
I was unable to attend, but really wanted to participate, so I watched the video JBrains did of his virtual session, then started in on my own implementation.
Now that the basic functionality is in place, I'd like to try adding some interesting UIs on top of it.  Two that spring to mind are WPF and MCV3 + Knockout.js.
